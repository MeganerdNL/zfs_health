# zfs_health

This is some shellcode to check health on ZFS volumes and email on any faults. I slightly adapted it from the original code at [Calomel.org](https://calomel.org/zfs_health_check_script.html) (for FreeBSD) to use in my own environment (Debian Linux), so Credtis go to Calomel.org. I added rudimentary logging and I added some code to make the date-logic work in Debian Linux.
